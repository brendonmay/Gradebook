-Styling Issues
	- "Thanks for signing in! Add a course to get started!
	- "Welcome Back! Select a course to get started!"
	- Fix buttons placements in each of the settings tabs.
	- Finish all of the styling in each of the settings tabs.
	- In Settings>Assessment Settings when you click edit and click on the input of the assessmentType Name, the underline color is not correct.
	- When you click the "today" button in the datepicker, color of highlighted circle is not correct.
	- Buttons in settings tab dont behave well as you change the size of the window. Possibl suggested solution, use display=none instead of adding class "hide" when they shouldnt be there. This can be achieved with the setAttribute() functiion.
	- Many modals get fucked up as you zoom in
	- Add Assessment Modal - Assessment Type drop down: determine a clean and nice way of differentiating the first dropdown item from the clickable drop down items! 
	- In the Assessments Tab, the text directing you to Assessment Settings doesnt dynamically move.

-Functionality Issues

	-turn current toasts into messages on the screen (like for email validation and password length)
	-email validation (not logging the user in until they confirm their email address)
	-error toast for trying to log in with the wrong password
- In Settings>General Settings, change Course Year to a dropdown menu.
- In each of the Settings' Tabs, check the input type to ensure only numbers can be inputted for the weights.
