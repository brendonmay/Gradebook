-Styling Issues
	- "Thanks for signing in! Add a course to get started!
	- "Welcome Back! Select a course to get started!"
	- Fix buttons placements in each of the settings tabs.
	- Finish all of the styling in each of the settings tabs.
	- Buttons in settings tab dont behave well as you change the size of the window. Possible suggested solution, use display=none instead of adding class "hide" when they shouldnt be there. This can be achieved with the setAttribute() functiion.
	- Add Assessment Modal - Assessment Type drop down: determine a clean and nice way of differentiating the first dropdown item from the clickable drop down items! 
	- In the Assessments Tab, the text directing you to Assessment Settings doesnt dynamically move.
	- Make all toasts appear in the top right of the nav bar
	- lining of Date input field in assign final evaluation and create assessment is off
	- Change most (if not all) toasts to custom error messages via jQuery validation + MaterializeCSS. I have already installed jQuery validation. Note: it is not up to date! Due to this supposedly being very buggy I highly suggest we install the latest version.

-Functionality Issues
	- Login
		-make the confirm password properly check the first password via validate (I started this in onRendered in register.js)
	- In each of the Settings' Tabs, check the input type to ensure only numbers can be inputted for the weights.
	- In assessments tab if you try to edit the date sometimes it wont let you (I think?)
	- When you change the year of a course, it will no longer be highlighted in the sideNav
	- When you delete a course that is in a folder with more than one course, another course will become highlighted, yet no information is shown
	- Limit the number of students of a class to 39.
	- Make it so that you cannot include the characters "," or "?" in the student first or last name.
	- Perhaps limit the length of the student first and last name?

	-Delete Coursework Assessment has white text with no banner/Add Course Work/Add Final Evaluation Work
	-In create new coursework, when checkbox is clicked focus on input field
