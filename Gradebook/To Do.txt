-Styling Issues
	- "Thanks for signing in! Add a course to get started!
	- "Welcome Back! Select a course to get started!"
	- Fix buttons placements in each of the settings tabs.
	- Buttons in settings tab dont behave well as you change the size of the window. Possible suggested solution, use display=none instead of adding class "hide" when they shouldnt be there. This can be achieved with the setAttribute() functiion.
	- Make it so that the gradebook has a different display if you have no students

-Functionality Issues
	- When you change the year of a course, it will no longer be highlighted in the sideNav (redirect with clicks)
	- When you add a new student/assessment, the last student/assessment on the list of the gradebook wont float as you scroll horizontally/vertically
	- If you hit tab multiple times in gradebook (past the end of the row), datepicker pops up
	- Notifications for changes in final evaluation should only appear if a change has been made.
	- Make it so that if they put an invalid input into the gradebook, it doesnt get pushed to the collection, and the cell becomes red
	- If K is disabled in the next row, enter isnt working;

	- In each of the Settings' Tabs, check the input type to ensure only numbers can be inputted for the weights.
	- Create new assessment modal error messages arent red for "Assessment Name" field
	- You are currently able to create an assessment even if you did not assign any grade points for K, A, T, or C.
	- Make it so that you can only input numbers >= 0 or N/A into the gradebook
