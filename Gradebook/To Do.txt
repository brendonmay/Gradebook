-Styling Issues
	- "Thanks for signing in! Add a course to get started!
	- "Welcome Back! Select a course to get started!"
	- Fix buttons placements in each of the settings tabs.
	- Finish all of the styling in each of the settings tabs.
	- Buttons in settings tab dont behave well as you change the size of the window. Possible suggested solution, use display=none instead of adding class "hide" when they shouldnt be there. This can be achieved with the setAttribute() functiion.
	- Add Assessment Modal - Assessment Type drop down: determine a clean and nice way of differentiating the first dropdown item from the clickable drop down items! 
	- In the Assessments Tab, the text directing you to Assessment Settings doesnt dynamically move.
	- Make all toasts appear in the top right of the nav bar
	- courseyears and courses listed in sidenav shift if you zoom in/out
	- Change most (if not all) toasts to custom error messages via jQuery validation + MaterializeCSS. I have already installed jQuery validation. Note: it is not up to date! Due to this supposedly being very buggy I highly suggest we install the latest version.

-Functionality Issues
	- When you change the year of a course, it will no longer be highlighted in the sideNav (redirect with clicks)
	
	- Make it so that you cannot include the characters "," or "?" in the student first or last name.
	- Perhaps limit the length of the student first and last name?
	- In each of the Settings' Tabs, check the input type to ensure only numbers can be inputted for the weights.
	- Create new assessment modal error messages arent red for "Assessment Name" field
