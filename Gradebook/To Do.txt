-Styling Issues
	- "Thanks for signing in! Add a course to get started!
	- "Welcome Back! Select a course to get started!"
	- Fix buttons placements in each of the settings tabs.
	- Finish all of the styling in each of the settings tabs.
	- In Settings>Assessment Settings when you click edit and click on the input of the assessmentType Name, the underline color is not correct.
	- When you click the "today" button in the datepicker, color of highlighted circle is not correct.
	- Buttons in settings tab dont behave well as you change the size of the window. Possibl suggested solution, use display=none instead of adding class "hide" when they shouldnt be there. This can be achieved with the setAttribute() functiion.
	- Many modals get fucked up as you zoom in
	- Add Assessment Modal - Assessment Type drop down: determine a clean and nice way of differentiating the first dropdown item from the clickable drop down items! 
	
-Functionality Issues
- Login
	-when registering, check if email is already in collection
	-make the user input their password twice
	-when logging in, check if password is incorrect or if email exists
- In Settings>General Settings, change Course Year to a dropdown menu.
- In each of the Settings' Tabs, check the input type to ensure only numbers can be inputted for the weights.
- Make it so assessmentTypes cannot have the same name
- Assessments tables currently arent reading the Date from the Collection
- Create a cancel button for createAssessmentModal
- Run checks before createAssessmentForm is submitted. Things to check:
	-max character length for assessment name
	-marks input can only be N/A or an integer > 0
- Before an assessment can be deleted, a modal should pop up confirming if you want to delete it.
- When you click the "X" to delete an assessment, make it so that the dropdown doesnt expand.
- Decide how to integrate editing assessments.
- Create a note under the final evaluations table in the Assessments tab, indicating that to delete a Final Evaluation it must be done via Course Settings>Assessment Settings with a hyperlink pointing them there.
