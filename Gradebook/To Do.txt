-Styling
	- "Thanks for signing in! Add a course to get started!
	- "Welcome Back! Select a course to get started!"
	- Make it so that the gradebook has a different display if you have no students

-Functionality
	- If you hit tab multiple times in gradebook (past the end of the row), datepicker pops up
	- When you create a new course in the most recent year relative to the other courses you have, and its the first course of that year, upon creation, the new course will be highlighted in the sidenav, but the mainview wont update.
	- After changing the courseyear of a course, when you edit to change it again, the displayed courseyear isnt the proper year.
	
	-studentReports dropdown not being refreshed after a new assessment type has been added/deleted. Why? 
-------------
-Figure out why I can't add script with src includes/globalFunctions/clearValidation.js 



-Work on bottom table-> popualting it dynamically 


-Refresh student reports on current student when you come back to the reports tab
-Populate Student grade graph -> from collection and for table use getWeightedAverage or something
