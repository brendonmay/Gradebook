-Styling Issues
	- "Thanks for signing in! Add a course to get started!
	- "Welcome Back! Select a course to get started!"
	- Fix buttons placements in each of the settings tabs.
	- Buttons in settings tab dont behave well as you change the size of the window. Possible suggested solution, use display=none instead of adding class "hide" when they shouldnt be there. This can be achieved with the setAttribute() functiion.
	- Make it so that the gradebook has a different display if you have no students

-Functionality Issues
	- When you change the year of a course, it will no longer be highlighted in the sideNav (redirect with clicks?)
	- If you hit tab multiple times in gradebook (past the end of the row), datepicker pops up
	- Notifications for changes in final evaluation should only appear if a change has been made.
	- Make it so that if they put an invalid input (you can only input numbers >= 0 or N/A) into the gradebook, it doesnt get pushed to the collection, and the cell becomes red
	- Make sure assessments tab jquery is thoroughly tested.
	- Assessments tab blur function for final evaluations is broken, wont save to collection.
	- When you create a new course in the most recent year relative to the other courses you have, and its the first course of that year, upon creation, the new course will be highlighted in the sidenav, but the mainview wont update.
	- When you delete an assessment from the gradebook, updategradebookcolors, probably also re-fix headers
	- on the final row of the gradebook, when you hit enter, the focus doesnt move as intended, but its not being submitted to collection.
	- When you create a new assessmentType, its not updating the assessments collection.
	- when you click course settings, if no other sub-menu is highlighted, highlight general settings

	-Repopulate edit students modal when opened 
	-Repopulate assessment settings when you hit edit 
	-Repopulate change asssessment name modal when opened
