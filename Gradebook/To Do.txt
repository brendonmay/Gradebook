-Styling
	- "Thanks for signing in! Add a course to get started!
	- "Welcome Back! Select a course to get started!"
	- Make it so that the gradebook has a different display if you have no students

-Functionality
	- If you hit tab multiple times in gradebook (past the end of the row), datepicker pops up
	- When you create a new course in the most recent year relative to the other courses you have, and its the first course of that year, upon creation, the new course will be highlighted in the sidenav, but the mainview wont update.
	- After changing the courseyear of a course, when you edit to change it again, the displayed courseyear isnt the proper year.
