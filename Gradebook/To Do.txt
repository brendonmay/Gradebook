-Styling Issues
	- "Thanks for signing in! Add a course to get started!
	- "Welcome Back! Select a course to get started!"
	- Fix buttons placements in each of the settings tabs.
	- Finish all of the styling in each of the settings tabs.
	- Buttons in settings tab dont behave well as you change the size of the window. Possible suggested solution, use display=none instead of adding class "hide" when they shouldnt be there. This can be achieved with the setAttribute() functiion.
	- Add Assessment Modal - Assessment Type drop down: determine a clean and nice way of differentiating the first dropdown item from the clickable drop down items! 
	- Change most (if not all) toasts to custom error messages via jQuery validation + MaterializeCSS. I have already installed jQuery validation.

-Functionality Issues
	- Login
		-make the confirm password properly check the first password via validate (I started this in onRendered in register.js)
	- In each of the Settings' Tabs, check the input type to ensure only numbers can be inputted for the weights.
	- You can assign or create assessments even if you don't input a date. Do we want it to be like that?
	- In assessments tab if you try to edit the date sometimes it wont let you.
