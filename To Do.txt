-Styling
	- "Thanks for signing in! Add a course to get started!
	- "Welcome Back! Select a course to get started!"
	- Gradebook display when you have no students
	- In student reports side-nav, create a title on the top "Students"
	- If you have no students in the student reports side-nav, offer a message to add students.
	- Make toasts appear in the bottom right corner.

-Functionality
	- If you hit tab multiple times in gradebook (past the end of the row), datepicker pops up
	- When you create a new course in the most recent year relative to the other courses you have, and its the first course of that year, upon creation, the new course will be highlighted in the sidenav, but the mainview wont update.
	- After changing the courseyear of a course, when you edit to change it again, the displayed courseyear isnt the proper year.
	- In student reports, if you select a student with id = "s-3" and then you go to a new course in student reports, student with Id "s-3" will be highlighted
	- if you click the logged in user in the top right, and then click it again, it shifts the page down a bit permanently
	- studentReports dropdown not being refreshed after a new assessment type has been added/deleted. Why? 
	- graphs and charts not always displaying correct data in student reports (make several assignments with App = N/A and see how it looks, maybe add one A mark)
	- In student reports, course overview, the studentmark breakdown graph isnt showing if theres no data
	- Hover over graphs break if you hover over broken student breakdown table in course overview
	- If you click edit in general settings, dont cancel, switch to another course, go to general settings, the edit will still be open.

Preloader:
	- when you select a new course in the sidenav, run a check to ensure you arent clicking the same tab, then run a preloader
	- after you login/immediately after you register, add a Preloader
	- after you change the course-year of a course, the preloader breaks for the rest of the site. Why?
	- after you change the course-year of a course, make the side-nav blurred and give it a preloader while it makes the changes.
	- make gradebook preloader only fill in the size of the main view, not nav and footer.

Scaling
	- https://medium.freecodecamp.org/scaling-meteor-a-year-on-26ee37588e4b
	- Disconnect users when they’ve been away for a while
	- MongoDB indexes are super important. Disconnect users when they’ve just left their tab open; It’s so simple to do and saves precious resources.
	- Make it so course assessment deletion occurs before assessment modal close? Perhaps will provide a longer opportunity for rendering.

Replace setTimeOut:
	- when you change courseyear, the sidenav gets messed up
	- when you select a new course in the sidenav, the table main row and column dont float and gradebook colors dont update unless you click it a second time
	- assign final and create new assessment in gradebook
	- after deleting an assessment directly in gradebook, colors arent properly updating

-------------
-Figure out why I can't add script with src includes/globalFunctions/clearValidation.js 


-Refresh student reports on current student when you come back to the reports tab
-Populate Student grade graph -> from collection and for table use getWeightedAverage or something
