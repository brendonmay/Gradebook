Styling
	- Properly center the suggestion to use chrome (or put in footer)
	- make sure site functions decently in internet explorer

	- feedback modal

Bugs
	- After changing the courseyear of a course, when you edit to change it again, the displayed courseyear isnt the proper year.
	- in assessments tab, if you change the mark out of for any category, when you hit enter 2 toasts appear. (only occurs on deployment, doesnt happen on Communication input)

New Functionality
	- Email verification on signup
	- Reset password functionality
	- allow ability to delete final evaluation directly from gradebook (doesnt delete the assessmentType, just "un-assigns" it)
	- add print student reports functionality
	- think of structure to allow administrators to view marks for the school
	
Scaling
	- MongoDB indexes are super important. 

Rolling Deployment
	- Deploy > 1 instance connected to same DB.
	- Learn how to backup database.
	- Look into Meteor Up + Digital Ocean combo
	- Look into MongoDB Atlas as opposed to MLab

Preloader:
