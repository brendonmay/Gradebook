	- MongoDB indexes are super important. 
	- Disconnect users when they’ve just left their tab open; It’s so simple to do and saves precious resources.

Replace setTimeOut (try Blaze.remove() and Blaze.render(), and then Template.onRendered will re-trigger each time):
	- when you change courseyear

Preloader:
	- Initial page load
	- logging in
	- loggging out
