Bugs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	IMPORTANT BUGS THAT NEED TO BE FIXED
	- If you delete an assessment where the student had 0% in that category, the mark of 0% isnt deleted and still affects the grade.
	- If you change how much a category is worth on an assessment after a grade for that category has already been assigned, the grade doesn't adjust automatically.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	- After changing the courseyear of a course, when you edit to change it again, the displayed courseyear isnt the proper year.
	- Add CVV to payment modal?

New Functionality
	Brendon
		- When you click edit icon in gradebook, modal pops up to edit, rather than being sent to assessments Tab
		- when you click a student's name in gradebook, it should be directed to the course overview page in student reports.
		
		- Allow gradebook to work for elementary teachers (refer to report card template to see courses they take, change from percentages to levels)
		- Think of structure to allow administrators to view marks for the school
	
	Josh
		- Reset password token should expire after its been used

Scaling
	- MongoDB indexes are super important. (I believe this is handled via mLab)
