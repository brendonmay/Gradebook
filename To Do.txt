Styling
	- verification email modal styling
	- make sure site functions decently in internet explorer
	- modify email templates for verify/reset password

Bugs
	- After changing the courseyear of a course, when you edit to change it again, the displayed courseyear isnt the proper year.
	- There seems to be a 15 character limit on renaming assessments in assessment tab. Is this correct? 
	- Check to make sure that reset password and email verifications are fully working once fully implemented.
	- make sure successfulLoginViews are both properly updated and hooked up to user database.
	- Email verification isnt working once clicked in email.
	- "you have yet to verify your email" - tell them to click link in email. Have option to-resend email.
	- "getExpiryDate" helper function, update the expiry date by pulling from Meteor.users
	- When you make a payment, when setting the expiration date, first check to see if they are expired. If expired, set it to 1 year from today, if not, set it to 1 year from the old expiration date.
	- fix the repeated Id's in successfulLoginNoCourseView, change it to a class and adjust the click event.
	
New Functionality
	- Add print student reports functionality (phantomjs?)
	- Think of structure to allow administrators to view marks for the school
	- Connect Paypal to Braintree
	- Switch braintree sandbox over to proper account for deployment
	- On account login, check to see if subscription is expired. If it is, lock the sideNav, change message in login-view.
	- If you have 15 days or less remaining on your subscription, change the font color to red instead of green.
	- Add an option to extend 
	- Make it so that payments are auto-billed every year?
	
Scaling
	- MongoDB indexes are super important. 

Preloader:
	- Initial page load?

-Refresh student reports on current student when you come back to the reports tab
-Populate Student grade graph -> from collection and for table use getWeightedAverage or something
