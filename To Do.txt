New Functionality
	Brendon
		- When you click edit icon in gradebook, modal pops up to edit, rather than being sent to assessments Tab
		- when you click a student's name in gradebook, it should be directed to the course overview page in student reports.
		
		- Allow gradebook to work for elementary teachers (refer to report card template to see courses they take, change from percentages to levels)
		- Think of structure to allow administrators to view marks for the school
