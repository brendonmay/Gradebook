-Styling
	- "Thanks for signing in! Add a course to get started!
	- "Welcome Back! Select a course to get started!"
	- Gradebook display when you have no students

-Functionality
	- graphs and charts not always displaying correct data in student reports (make several assignments with App = N/A and see how it looks, maybe add one A mark)
	- After changing the courseyear of a course, when you edit to change it again, the displayed courseyear isnt the proper year.
	- In student reports, if you select a student with id = "s-3" and then you go to a new course in student reports, student with Id "s-3" will be highlighted
	- In student reports, course overview, the studentmark breakdown graph isnt showing if theres no data
	- When you create a new course in the most recent year relative to the other courses you have, and its the first course of that year, upon creation, the new course will be highlighted in the sidenav, but the mainview wont update.
	- studentReports dropdown not being refreshed after a new assessment type has been added/deleted. Why? 
	- change z-index of dropdown in student reports so it is on-top of everything else	
	- if you click the logged in user in the top right, and then click it again, it shifts the page down a bit permanently
	- If you hit tab multiple times in gradebook (past the end of the row), datepicker pops up

Preloader:
	- assign final and create new assessment in gradebook (dont do it on every modal close, run a check if new assessment has been created)
	- deleting an assessment directly in gradebook (dont do it on every modal close, run a check if new assessment has been created)
	- when you select a new course in the sidenav, run a check to ensure you arent clicking the same tab, then run a preloader
	- after you login/immediately after you register, add a Preloader
	- after you change the course-year of a course, the preloader breaks for the rest of the site. Why?
	- after you change the course-year of a course, make the side-nav blurred and give it a preloader while it makes the changes.

Scaling

	- Disconnect users when they’ve been away for a while
	- MongoDB indexes are super important. Disconnect users when they’ve just left their tab open; It’s so simple to do and saves precious resources.
	- Make it so course assessment deletion occurs before assessment modal close? Perhaps will provide a longer opportunity for rendering.

Replace setTimeOut:
	- when you change courseyear, the sidenav gets messed up
	- when you select a new course in the sidenav, the table main row and column dont float and gradebook colors dont update unless you click it a second time
	- assign final and create new assessment in gradebook
	- after deleting an assessment directly in gradebook, colors arent properly updating

-------------
-Figure out why I can't add script with src includes/globalFunctions/clearValidation.js 


-Refresh student reports on current student when you come back to the reports tab
-Populate Student grade graph -> from collection and for table use getWeightedAverage or something
