Bugs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	IMPORTANT BUGS THAT NEED TO BE FIXED
	- Gmail suspects suspicious activity when mail is sent via SMTP, I turned on 2-step verification and linked it to the STMP, hopefully that will fix the problem.
	- If when you create an account, the account gets bugged because the user database doesnt include the full structure, it is because the STMP email is failing.

	- After changing the courseyear of a course, when you edit to change it again, the displayed courseyear isnt the proper year.
	- Add CVV to payment modal?

New Functionality
	Brendon
		Grades 1-8 Integration:
		- When you first register, state whether you are an elementary teacher (Grades 1-8) or Secondary Teacher (Grades 9-12)
			- Add this information to the user collection
		- If teacher is elementary, change "add course" button to "add class"
			- When you add a class, select school year and grade you are teaching, name the class (short character count), and ask if they teach in a catholic school.
			- When you create a class for that specific grade, automatically create all of the courses they will need by referring to the report card templates.
		- Add option in dropdown menu: "Account Settings". Here a modal appears to modify their name or change if they are an elementary or secondary teacher.
		- On the login page, mention the teacher's name and what type of teacher they are. (e.g. Welcome Back Brendon May (Secondary Teacher)). Perhaps provide a hyperlink to Account Settings to change if its incorrect.
		- 

		Quality of Life Changes:
		- Add "pulse" class to the add course button when they first sign up. Remove the class once theyve created their first course.
		- When you click edit icon in gradebook, modal pops up to edit, rather than being sent to assessments Tab
		- when you click a student's name in gradebook, it should be directed to the course overview page in student reports.
		
		Other Thoughts:
		- Think of structure to allow administrators to view marks for the school

		- Reset password token should expire after its been used

Scaling
	- MongoDB indexes are super important. (I believe this is handled via mLab)
