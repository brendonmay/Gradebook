-Styling
	- "Thanks for signing in! Add a course to get started!
	- "Welcome Back! Select a course to get started!"
	- Make it so that the gradebook has a different display if you have no students

-Functionality
	- If you hit tab multiple times in gradebook (past the end of the row), datepicker pops up
	- When you create a new course in the most recent year relative to the other courses you have, and its the first course of that year, upon creation, the new course will be highlighted in the sidenav, but the mainview wont update.
	- After changing the courseyear of a course, when you edit to change it again, the displayed courseyear isnt the proper year.
	- In student reports, if you select a student with id = "s-3" and then you go to a new course in student reports, student with Id "s-3" will be highlighted
	- if you click the logged in user in the top right, and then click it again, it shifts the page down a bit permanently
	- studentReports dropdown not being refreshed after a new assessment type has been added/deleted. Why? 
	- graphs and charts not always displaying correct data in student reports (make several assignments with App = N/A and see how it looks, maybe add one A mark)
	- change z-index of dropdown in student reports so it is on-top of everything else
	- In student reports, course overview, the studentmark breakdown graph isnt showing if theres no data

Replace setTimeOut for the following in the future:
	- when you change courseyear, the sidenav gets messed up
	- after deleting an assessment directly in gradebook, colors arent properly updating
	- when you select a new course in the sidenav, the table main row and column dont float and gradebook colors dont update unless you click it a second time

Scaling

	- Disconnect users when they’ve been away for a while
	- MongoDB indexes are super important. Disconnect users when they’ve just left their tab open; It’s so simple to do and saves precious resources.

-------------
-Figure out why I can't add script with src includes/globalFunctions/clearValidation.js 


-Refresh student reports on current student when you come back to the reports tab
-Populate Student grade graph -> from collection and for table use getWeightedAverage or something
