Styling

Bugs
	- After changing the courseyear of a course, when you edit to change it again, the displayed courseyear isnt the proper year.
	- Should the reset password token expire after its been used?
	- Store the Braintree information in settings.json, dont include their actual values in the code.
	
New Functionality
	Brendon
		- When a user misses a payment or cancels, send out an email automatically via Braintree?
		- Add option to cancel subscription
		- Make it very clear that the payment is a subscription, that they will be auto-billed.
		- on payment (or perhaps on registration), have them enter their full name? See how to adjust the dropin UI to include this?
		- add option to re-activate subscription if it's canceled.

		- Connect Paypal to Braintree (will have to create a merchant paypal account)
		- Switch braintree sandbox over to proper account for deployment
		- Think of structure to allow administrators to view marks for the school
	
	Josh
		- Add print student reports functionality (phantomjs?)

Scaling
