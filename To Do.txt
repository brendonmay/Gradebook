Styling
	- verification email modal styling
	- puchase subscription modal styling
	- make sure site functions decently in internet explorer
	- modify email templates for verify/reset password
	- reset password modal, Your password must contain at least 1 number./Your password must be at least 7 characters./Your password must contain at least 1 upper case letter. (red), make all error messages red
	- reset password modal, after you submit the form and the email is sent, disable the reset button so they cant click it again.

Bugs
	- After changing the courseyear of a course, when you edit to change it again, the displayed courseyear isnt the proper year.
	- There seems to be a 15 character limit on renaming assessments in assessment tab. Is this correct?
	- Check to make sure that reset password and email verifications are fully working once fully implemented.
	- Email verification isnt working once clicked in email.
	- "you have yet to verify your email" - tell them to click link in email. Have option to-resend email.
	- When you make a payment, when setting the expiration date, first check to see if they are expired. If expired, set it to 1 year from today, if not, set it to 1 year from the old expiration date.
	
New Functionality
	- Add print student reports functionality (phantomjs?)
	- Think of structure to allow administrators to view marks for the school
	- Connect Paypal to Braintree
	- Switch braintree sandbox over to proper account for deployment
	- Make it so that payments are auto-billed every year?
	
Scaling
	- MongoDB indexes are super important. 

Preloader:
