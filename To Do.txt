Bugs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	IMPORTANT BUGS THAT NEED TO BE FIXED
	- If you input a grade of 0 many issues arise in the student reports page:
		-Student Breakdown Graphs do not show a mark of zero when you highlight over them (- appears instead of 0). This only happens on Student Breakdown graphs, not the Student Grade or Class Average graphs.
		-Student Breakdown tables do not display a 0 when it is given (KATC categories show N/A). Grade is calculated incorrectly due to the N/As. I believe this problem is tied directly to the Student Breakdown graph as I believe it uses the exact same data.
		-Full Mark Breakdown table does not display a 0 when it is given, it instead shows N/A. The grade column does not calculate their final grade properly in this case, as it is not treating the N/As as zeroes.
	- Final Exam and Culminating Task Student Breakdown Graph does not work, and table displays N/A for all entries
	- If you change how much a category is worth on an assessment after a grade for that category has already been assigned, the grade doesn't adjust automatically.

	- After changing the courseyear of a course, when you edit to change it again, the displayed courseyear isnt the proper year.
	- Add CVV to payment modal?

New Functionality
	Brendon
		- When you click edit icon in gradebook, modal pops up to edit, rather than being sent to assessments Tab
		- when you click a student's name in gradebook, it should be directed to the course overview page in student reports.
		
		- Allow gradebook to work for elementary teachers (refer to report card template to see courses they take, change from percentages to levels)
		- Think of structure to allow administrators to view marks for the school

		- Reset password token should expire after its been used

Scaling
	- MongoDB indexes are super important. (I believe this is handled via mLab)
