Styling
	- make sure site functions decently in internet explorer
	
Bugs
	- After changing the courseyear of a course, when you edit to change it again, the displayed courseyear isnt the proper year.
	- Should the reset password token expire after its been used?
	- Store the Braintree information in settings.json, dont include their actual values in the code.
	
New Functionality
	- Add option to cancel subscription
	- Make it very clear that the payment is a subscription, that they will be auto-billed.
	- Add print student reports functionality (phantomjs?)
	- Think of structure to allow administrators to view marks for the school
	- Connect Paypal to Braintree (will have to create a merchant paypal account)
	- Switch braintree sandbox over to proper account for deployment
	- on payment (or perhaps on registration), have them enter their full name? See how to adjust the dropin UI to include this?
	
Scaling
	- MongoDB indexes are super important.
