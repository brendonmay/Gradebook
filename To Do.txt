Bugs
	- After changing the courseyear of a course, when you edit to change it again, the displayed courseyear isnt the proper year.
	- When you make a payment, when setting the expiration date, first check to see if they are expired. If expired, set it to 1 year from today, if not, set it to 1 year from the old expiration date.
	- reset password modal, after you submit the form and the email is sent, disable/hide the reset button so they cant click it again.
	- Remove "Click the "Add Course" button to Get Started" text when user's subscription has expired
	- Console errors due to "Cannot read property 'date' of undefined" on page load 

New Functionality
	- Add print student reports functionality (phantomjs?)
	- Think of structure to allow administrators to view marks for the school
	- Connect Paypal to Braintree
	- Switch braintree sandbox over to proper account for deployment
	- Make it so that payments are auto-billed every year?
	
Scaling
	- MongoDB indexes are super important. 

Preloader:
	- Initial page load?
