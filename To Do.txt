Bugs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	IMPORTANT BUGS THAT NEED TO BE FIXED
	- Gmail suspects suspicious activity when mail is sent via SMTP, I turned on 2-step verification and linked it to the STMP, hopefully that will fix the problem.
	- If when you create an account, the account gets bugged because the user database doesnt include the full structure, it is because the STMP email is failing.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	- After changing the courseyear of a course, when you edit to change it again, the displayed courseyear isnt the proper year.
	- Add CVV to payment modal?

New Functionality
	Brendon
		- When you click edit icon in gradebook, modal pops up to edit, rather than being sent to assessments Tab
		- when you click a student's name in gradebook, it should be directed to the course overview page in student reports.
		
		- Allow gradebook to work for elementary teachers (refer to report card template to see courses they take, change from percentages to levels)
		- Think of structure to allow administrators to view marks for the school
	
	Josh
		- Reset password token should expire after its been used

Scaling
	- MongoDB indexes are super important. (I believe this is handled via mLab)
